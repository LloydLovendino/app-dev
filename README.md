And because of the saying “All Is Well “, the child starts to cry and is known to be alive.                                                                                                           3.when Rancho's professor asks him what a machine is. He describes it in simple words but it does not seem to fit right with the professor who is expecting a text-book definition. The scene ends on a funny note when the professor asks him to get out of the room.
